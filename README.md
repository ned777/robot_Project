# Robot â€” eBay Product Title Scraper (Playwright, Python 3.14, Ubuntu 24.04)

## Overview
This project demonstrates browser automation using **Playwright** with **Python 3.14**.  
It launches Chromium, searches eBay for the keyword **"kvm displayport"**, scrolls to trigger lazy-loaded results, and prints the first valid product title (skipping sponsored listings).
